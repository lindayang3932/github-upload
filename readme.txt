 For my 15-112 term project, I decided to replicate the three dimensional game Octagon. In the game, you are an object trapped inside an 
 octagonal tunnel, which includes hallways, platforms, and gaps. The goal of the game to reach the end of the octagon in time. I created
 the game strictly using tkinter and does not require any other outside modules
