 The goal of this project was to recreate the three dimensional game Octagon. To create the three dimensional illusion, I made a class called walls, which I used to create each wall of the tunnel. Each wall has a unque theta value that distinguished its position on the canvas. I made a list of all of the walls to which I called in the redraw function. The wall class created a trapezoid (the collection of the eight trapezoids creates an octogon) and when called in the timerfired, increased by a factor of 1.1. When the corners of each trapezoid reached a certain point on the canvas, a new set of walls were appended to the list. The position and the color of the newly appended 
 wall was randomly generated. I emulated gaps in the tunnel by appending walls that were white. I used the corners of the octagonal black object and the color and the position of the corners of the white trapezoid to create detection of the black object falling into gap. The position of a newly appended walls is centered around a vanishing point in the middle of the canvas to the create the illusion of a continuous tunnel. Hitting the left and right keys rotates each wall by a certain theta value. I used this algorithm because it allowed me to achieve a 3d illusion on tkinter without having the program become too laggy.  

 On the home screen, the user has the option to start the game or to see the instructions, levels, and scores. When the game has started, the player has the left and right control arrows to rotate the tunnel to avoid gaps. If the user loses in the first level, they have an option of restarting. Winning the first level gives the user access to the second level, which is harder and involves more gaps. If the user loses on the second level, they must start over from level one. At the end of the second level, on the homescreen, the user has the option of comparing their scores to those who have already played by clicking on the scores button.
